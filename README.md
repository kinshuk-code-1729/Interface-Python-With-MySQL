# Interface-Python-With-MySQL
 This repository contains some codes of MySQL Connectivity with python.
In this Repository there are several Python snippets that connect the MySQL database with the Python scripts. When we design real-life applications , we are bound to encounter situations wherein we need to manipulate data stored in a database through an application designed by us . In order to connect to a database from within Python , we need a library that provides connectivity functionality. There are many different libraries available for Python to accomplish this but in this repository I've used mysql connector library for the same.By connecting our Python script with the MySQL database  we can execute many MySQL queries through our Python environment without launching the MySQL application for the same. It just creates a remote connection with the database  by creating a connection object so that we can create , alter , manipulate with the records stored in a table and also we can access the databases and the tables stored in them and we can also extract the data to the result-set through which we can fetch the MySQL data to the output screen of the Python environment also.
