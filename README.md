# Interface-Python-With-MySQL
## This repository contains some codes of MySQL Connectivity with python.

- *This repository contains various Python snippets that connect the MySQL database to the Python scripts. When designing real-world applications, we are certain to come across instances in which we need to manipulate data contained in a database using an application that we built. To connect to a database from within Python, we need a library that provides connectivity capabilities.*
- *There are other Python libraries available to accomplish this task, but in this repository, I utilized the mysql connector package.By linking our Python script to the MySQL database, we can run several MySQL queries without having to launch the MySQL program. It simply establishes a remote connection with the database by creating a connection object, allowing us to create, alter, and manipulate the records stored in a table, as well as access the databases and tables stored in them.*
- *We can also extract data to the result-set, which allows us to fetch MySQL data to the Python environment's output screen.*
